# AFKFlash
This addon was built to combat the long queue times in WoW classic that Blizzard doesn't seem to care about. If you find yourself alt-tabbing while AFK, this addon will help you avoid logging out and having to re-queue.

Flashes the client taskbar icon when AFK is detected, as well as displays a popup window in-game. Sends a follow up flash 5-10 minutes before logout. You can also provide a whisper target to receive whispers for the alerts. This is useful when you are playing on multiple clients simultaneously and the flash doesn't always show up. For commands, use /afkflash

NOTE: this does NOT remove your AFK automatically. It is simply a notification system for when you go AFK. Blizzard does not allow any addons that keep you from going AFK.
